                Clique is the best way to easily form private groups and share recommendations about online content with your friends. Think of it like a virtual bookclub where instead of books, a group of friends share anything they are enjoying online-- videos, photos, music, writing, games, or whatever else. 

<br><br>
        Sign up, create a group, invite some friends, and then start sharing and discussing the most interesting things you see online. It's that simple. We provide all the tools, like group chat, notifications, and a browser extension, to make sharing and discussing content with a group of friends easy and fund. Stay connected and stay informed with your Clique groups.

        <div class="large-8 columns">
          <p style="color:white;"> Clique  makes it easy to share what you are browsing online with groups of friends and vice versa. Share what you love, and see what your friends are enjoying and talking about - the newest Buzzfeed article, the hottest music video, or the most interesting article or blog post. It's like a Flipboard or Upworthy run by your friends, a place online where you can find personal tips on what to check out, sent your way by people who actually know you.

        </div>  
        <div class="large-8 columns">
          <p style="color:white;"> We don't rely on algorithms or topic channels - with Clique, your social groups are your channels. We want to move away from mindless feeds, repetitive news streams, and personalization algorithms. Clique is unique because it is built on the idea that your friends, not machines, know you best and can connect you with what inspires and excites you. We let you make the decision of what to share with who and we don't get in the way - what your friends post to your groups is what you get!

          <p style="color:white;"> The internet is a huge, weird place, but we only see a small part of it. By offering your friends a way to share what they are reading, watching, or enjoying online, Clique provides you a way to explore the nooks and crannies of the internet. Break out of your Facebook bubble and discover something unexpected!
